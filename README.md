# HTML Website

This Repository contains the code for my initial website as I learn to use html, css, and javascript. At the present moment it only uses html, however as I learn to use more css and javascript the website will be updated. You can access the website using this link https://talaaltahir.github.io/cv/ , or downloading the files and opening it on your local device.
